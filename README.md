## CSE 373 - P1

A set of programs implementing LinkedDeques with defined methods and constraints

Implement our Deque interface in LinkedDeque, subject to the following additional requirements:

-*add, remove*, and *size* must run in constant time (operations must not involve any looping or recursion). Note: size is provided for you.
-*get* must use iteration, not recursion.
-The amount of memory that your program uses at any given time must be proportional to the number of items. For example, if you add 10,000 items to the deque, and then remove 9,999 items, the resulting data structure should use memory similar to a deque with 1 item. Do not maintain references to items that are no longer in the deque.
-Your implementation must use sentinel nodes and adhere to the associated invariants.
